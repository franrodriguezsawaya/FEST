# How to start

This project uses the `parcel-bundler` as an easy way to get started using html and js for a simple web page.

1. Run `npm install` from the root of this project
2. Run `npm run start` from the root of this project

You should know be able to access the project from url that parcel displays on the command line. In my instance it is `http://localhost:1234`

When writing your scripts there is now no need to reload the page. Parcel should automatically update the page for you.
